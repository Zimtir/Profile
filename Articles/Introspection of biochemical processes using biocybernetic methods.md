## Abstract
Modern information technologies make it possible to rethink fundamental concepts of ethics, medicine and chemistry, creating knowledge at their intersection, which help to formalize information about human nature into data processed for computational methods. This article is a review and detailed consideration of the human body modernizing idea and solving some ethical issues of bioinformatics by forming a concept of the human body communication device. An important factor is the minimization of the destructive effect on the human body. The subject of this research is the ability of the human body to work together with an information computing device. The authors consider various ways to implement the most autonomous device into the human body for the purpose of further data exchange. Scientific articles by Russian and foreign authors were used as the materials for this research. The research is carried out by methods of scientific source review, comparison of different points of view and generalizations, idea generation from the experience and facts accumulated by the human community. The novelty of the research is the synergy of weakly dependent areas and getting mixed results for further work and research. Special attention is paid to the risks of using such technology, the theoretically described possibilities of the development of the approach, problems of ethical perception and biological compatibility. In the conclusion the presented results confirm the need to apply the approach and use the device in the modern world which emphasizes the relevance of the research; the conclusions are formed with qualitative and quantitative indicators in relation to the obtained results of the conducted research.
