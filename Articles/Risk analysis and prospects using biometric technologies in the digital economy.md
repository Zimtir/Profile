Biometrics technologies have become more commonly used as an authentication method in various

also some distrust among users. In this article, we examined both the social aspect of biometrics and the
technological one. We have identified the main reasons for usersâ€™ skepticism, considered the actual problems
facing this technology, and also proposed options for their solution.
