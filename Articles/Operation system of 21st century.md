## Abstract
This article is about a new operating system, which opens a new way in the sphere
of information technology. This operating system will be written in the programming language Java and will work with cloud service storage.

**Key words**: 

  - operating system
  - future
  - Java
  - cloud storage.

## Text
In the field of information technology there is an unsolved problem. 
Imagine what will Windows or Linux look like in the year 2050? 
It seems to me that it's boring. What is needed to make our future beautiful? 
We need a new operating system! Approximately by 2020–2025 the Internet will be used by everyone on the Earth, but for what?
To watch movies and perform search queries? 
It's funny that you have to do this in Windows OS. What kind of operating system is needed and why does not it still exist?

Let's start with a simple one. Any operating system is established on devices of user.
 Today there is a large number of cloud storage services of data [1].
Our new operating system of the 21st century will make us work just with these cloud storage services.
Imagine that you have a desktop computer, laptop, tablet, smartphone.
What devices you will include – it does not matter, but you will always find our operating system of the 21st century. 
It will not depend on the type of your device. 
It is in the cloud.
That is, if you rename a text document from your smartphone, then when you turn on the laptop on your desktop, you will find a renamed text document.
How does it work?

The user has cloud storage with an already installed operating system of the 21st century.
On its device a constant Internet connection is installed. 
When the user turns on the device, a dialog box appears, in which one enters a user’s login and password.
After that, a reliable connection is made to connect to the cloud, which sends the request. User receives a response in the form of bytecode from the cloud.
This response is used for making operating system with the help of kernel. 
No viruses, because all Internet connections, games and search's requests exist only in the cloud. 
You just get the answers which appear on the monitor screen. 

For the beginning we will not use a cloud technology at once because today not every man on Earth has a constant Internet connection. 
But we will use a hard disk drive which synchronizes data between device and cloud.

What programming language do we need to implement a similar operating system of the 21st century?
Who can work with the computer code as well as it does the programming language Assembler? 
It is a programming language “Java”!
In 1996, Oracle tried to create Java OS with the help of IBM. 
Now Java feels great among the programming languages, it holds the leading position and we may use its capabilities for work with the byte-code for making the operating system of the 21st century.
How much time and money will it take to develop such a miracle? Approximately 1–2 years and a team of 6 developers are needed to create this operating system from scratch.
A question will arise – how much money is needed for this aim? 
Nearly for 5 dollars you will get a licensed version.

What is the future of this operating system? In the films about the future, we see supercomputers and their tremendous power. 
Do you seriously think that "Windows" will be able to do it? 
Also in the first years of the life of this operating system it can easily be optimized for the most frequent users of computers and laptops – gamers. 
In the end, now there are about 1.3 billion people who play on personal computers and other devices. 
This makes you think. 
Optimizing the operating system for them, the market of Microsoft and Apple will collapse right before our eyes.
What for?
It's simple. 
Most players do not use Linux, because it does not support majority of games. 
But if you use a product, Microsoft, you can simply forget about the performance of your computer. 
How much does a licensed version of Windows 10 cost? 150 dollars?
It’s too much.
And how much does a licensed copy of Mac OS cost? 
I think we need to create a 21st century operating system to drive the world's giants out of the market and create a new project, as it once happened to Sun Microsystems and their monopoly in mobile applications.
Change is necessary, and in order to keep pace with the time, we must now think about our future in information technology.

After a while, you can improve this operating system and write the source code for managing the computer with the help of a person's voice.
Write an automated bot that will work in your operating system and will be your friend.
Create a whole world for programmers and give them the opportunity to create software on their own.
Reduce the cost of a desktop computer and its components, since now the computer's performance depends on them, and not every user can buy a new RAM module to include their favorite game.

Why is Java such a giant and we do not hear much about it? 
For example, the famous Minecraft game was written in Java.
If Microsoft did not trample down Java in the 90s, then Minecraft would be the best of programs for easy build of real homes.
And what about Steve Jobs?
He himself never liked Java, no one except Adobe supported Java, and it could optimize the work of Macdevices.
Even IBM, which values the Java language, tried to crush Sun by creating an IDE for Java and calling it Eclipse.
Blu-Ray is created around Java and consists of a mixture of compressed video and byte-code. 
Despite all the mistakes of the creators, Java rapidly strengthened its position on the servers and became usable in the desktop segment. 
Every technology that will be used to combat political currents, and in the case of Java, it works hard, proving that it is an excellent tool for solving problems.

We can talk a lot about Java and its advantages and why we need to create an operating system that should not cause horror or fear for it.
We should think first of all about what is important to us, namely, the future of computer technology that is, future programmers, free code and use it, the present will work with the future.
Creating new boundaries of the impossible and possible can do what they were afraid to touch many years ago, now we have an advanced language, a huge audience and talented people with brilliant ideas.
In my personal opinion, Java and my idea should be implemented.
